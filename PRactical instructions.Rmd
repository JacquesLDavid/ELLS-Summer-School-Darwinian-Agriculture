# Practical Session on Phenotypic Value Decomposition and Selection Effects

# Introduction
Welcome to this practical session on the decomposition of phenotypic value and the effects of selection. In this session, we will explore how the phenotypic value of a plant is influenced by its genotype and the genotypes of its neighbors, and how selection on these traits affects the next generation.

# Key Concepts

## Decomposition of Phenotypic Value
Classically, The phenotypic value ($P$) of an individual can be decomposed into multiple components:
$$ P = G + E $$
Where:
- **G** represents the genetic contribution to the phenotype.
- **E** represents the environmental contribution to the phenotype.

If we introduce the fact that the phenotype of an individual can be determined by its own genotype and by the genotypes of its neighbours, G can be decomposed into a *D*irect *G*enetic *E*ffect ($DGE$) and the $I*ndirect *G*enetic *E*ffect (IGE) from neighboring individuals, the model becomes:
$$P = DGE + IGE + E_{DGE} + E_{IGE}$$
Where:
- **DGE (Direct Genetic Effect)**: The contribution of the individual's own genotype to its phenotype.
- **IGE (Indirect Genetic Effect)**: The contribution of the genotypes of neighboring individuals to the individual's phenotype.  

- $E_{DGE}$  (environment effect on Direct Genetic Effect)
- $E_{IGE}$  (environment effect on Indirect Genetic Effect)

These components have their associated variances : $V_{DGE},V_{DGE}, V_{E_{DGE}}, V_{E_{IGE}}$

## Correlation between DGE and IGE
The DGE and IGE can be correlated. This correlation affects the overall response to selection. If a mass selection is performed based on phenotypic value, the selection acts on both the individual's genotype and the genotypes of its neighbors, a concept known as the social phenotype.

##### True Breeding Value (TBV)
The true breeding value (TBV) integrates both DGE and IGE. It is an important metric for predicting the genetic value of the next generation, particularly when social interactions are considered. The TBV is influenced by the correlation between DGE and IGE and can be calculated as:
\[ TBV = DGE + \sum IGE \]
where \(\sum IGE\) represents the sum of the indirect genetic effects from all relevant neighbors.

##### Environmental Effects
Environmental effects (\(E\)) play a significant role in shaping the phenotypic value. These effects can be unique to each individual (specific environment) or shared among individuals (common environment). In our model, we consider environmental variances for both DGE and IGE.

#### Bibliographic Context
Understanding the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to phenotypic variance has been a core pursuit in quantitative genetics. The inclusion of social interactions, as captured by IGE, has been pivotal in advancing breeding programs, particularly in plants and animals with significant social structures. Studies (ref) have laid the foundation for integrating IGEs into genetic models, highlighting their impact on selection response and breeding strategies.

#### Simulation Algorithm
The simulation algorithm used in this practical session involves the following steps:

1. **Matrix Preparation**: Genetic (G) and environmental (E) variance-covariance matrices are prepared based on user inputs.
2. **Genotype and Neighborhood Generation**: Genotypes and environmental effects are generated for a grid of plants, and neighbors are assigned randomly.
3. **Phenotypic Value Calculation**: The phenotypic value for each plant is calculated as the sum of its DGE, the IGEs from its neighbors, and environmental effects.
4. **Selection**: A proportion of the top-performing plants is selected based on their phenotypic values.
5. **Next Generation Prediction**: The mean genetic values for the next generation are predicted based on the selected plants, taking into account the variances and covariance between DGE and IGE.

#### Detailed Steps in the Simulation

1. **Matrix Preparation**:
    - Calculate the covariance between DGE and IGE based on the user-provided genetic correlation.
    - Form the genetic variance-covariance matrix \(G\) and the environmental variance-covariance matrix \(E\).

    ```r
    covdgE_IGE <- input$r * (input$varG11 * input$varG22)^0.5
    G <- matrix(c(input$varG11, covdgE_IGE, covdgE_IGE, input$varG22), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
    E <- matrix(c(input$varE11, 0, 0, input$varE22), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
    ```

2. **Genotype and Neighborhood Generation**:
    - Generate genotype values using a multivariate normal distribution for a grid of \(N \times N\) plants.
    - Generate environmental effects similarly.
    - Assign neighbors randomly on a grid using a neighborhood matrix.

    ```r
    genotype <- mvrnorm(n = N^2, mu = c(0, 0), Sigma = G)
    enviro <- mvrnorm(n = N^2, mu = c(0, 0), Sigma = E)
    voisinage <- matrix(sample(1:N^2, 4*N^2, replace = TRUE), nrow = 2*N, ncol = 2*N)
    ```

3. **Phenotypic Value Calculation**:
    - For each plant, calculate its DGE and sum the IGEs from its neighbors.
    - Add environmental effects to obtain the total phenotypic value.

    ```r
    Valeur_G <- function(x, y, genotype, voisinage) {
        geno <- c()
        for (i in (x-1):(x+1)) {
            for (j in (y-1):(y+1)) {
                if (!(i == x && j == y)) {
                    geno <- c(geno, voisinage[i, j])
                }
            }
        }
        DGE <- genotype[voisinage[x, y], 1] + enviro[voisinage[x, y], 1]
        IGE <- sum(genotype[geno, 2] + enviro[geno, 2])
        return(DGE + IGE)
    }

    Pheno <- c()
    tri_geno <- c()
    cpt <- 0

    for (x in 5:(N+5)) {
        for (y in 5:(N+5)) {
            cpt <- cpt + 1
            Pheno[cpt] <- Valeur_G(x, y, genotype, voisinage)
            tri_geno[cpt] <- voisinage[x, y]
        }
    }
    ```

4. **Selection**:
    - Rank individuals by their phenotypic values.
    - Select the top proportion (\(p\)) of individuals.

    ```r
    N_sel <- round(cpt * input$p)
    geno_sel <- genotype[tri_geno[order(Pheno, decreasing = TRUE)][1:N_sel], ]
    ```

5. **Next Generation Prediction**:
    - Calculate the mean genetic values for the next generation based on the selected individuals.
    - Adjust the mean values considering the response to selection, including the correlation between DGE and IGE.

    ```r
    S <- c()
    S[1] <- mean(genotype[tri_geno[order(Pheno, decreasing = TRUE)][1:N_sel], 1])
    S[2] <- mean(genotype[tri_geno[order(Pheno, decreasing = TRUE)][1:N_sel], 2])

    R <- G %*% solve(P) %*% S
    mus <- mu
    mus[1] <- mu[1] + R[1]
    mus[2] <- mu[2] + R[2]

    new_geno <- mvrnorm(n = N^2, mu = mus, Sigma = G)
    new_voisinage <- matrix(sample(1:N^2, 4*N^2, replace = TRUE), nrow = 2*N, ncol = 2*N)

    new_Pheno <- c()
    new_tri_geno <- c()
    cpt <- 0

    for (x in 5:(N+5)) {
        for (y in 5:(N+5)) {
            cpt <- cpt + 1
            new_Pheno[cpt] <- Valeur_G(x, y, new_geno, new_voisinage)
            new_tri_geno[cpt] <- new_voisinage[x, y]
        }
    }
    ```

7. View the results in the "Graph" and "Summary" tabs, which show the genotype distribution, phenotypic distributions before and after selection, and a summary of the calculations.

#### Suggested Parameters
To help you understand the effects of selection, try using the following parameter values:

- **Number of individuals (N)**: 20
- **Genetic variance DGE (\(V_{DGE}\))**: 0.75
- **Genetic variance IGE (\(V_{IGE}\))**: 0.07
- **Genetic correlation DGE : IGE (\(r\))**: 0.5

- **Selection pressure (\(p\))**: 0.3

Observe how changes in these parameters affect the selection outcomes and the predicted genetic values of the next generation.
