# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Overview

### 1.1.1 Context and Objectives

This workshop aims to explore the principles of Darwinian agriculture with a focus on social evolution under different selection strategies. The primary objectives include:

- Understanding the fundamentals of mass selection and true breeding values.
- Applying theoretical concepts to practical scenarios.

## 1.2 Structure of the Workshop

The workshop will be divided into several key sections:

1. Introduction
2. Theoretical Background
3. Practical Application
4. Discussion and Analysis
5. Questions and Answers

# 2. Theoretical Background

## 2.1 Mass Selection

### 2.1.1 Definition and Principles

Mass selection is a breeding method where individuals are selected based on their phenotypic traits. This section covers:

- The definition of mass selection.
- The principles and mechanisms involved.

## 2.2 True Breeding Values

### 2.2.1 Concept and Application

True breeding values refer to the genetic potential of an individual. This section includes:

- The concept of true breeding values.
- How to calculate and apply these values in breeding programs.

# 3. Practical Application

## 3.1 Case Studies

### 3.1.1 Example 1: Crop Yield Improvement

In this case study, we will analyze the impact of mass selection on crop yield.

## 3.2 Exercises

### 3.2.1 Practical Exercise 1

Conduct an exercise to select individuals based on given phenotypic data.

# 4. Discussion and Analysis

## 4.1 Group Discussion

### 4.1.1 Key Points

Discuss the outcomes of the practical exercises and share insights.

# 5. Questions and Answers

## 5.1 Expanded Questions for Students

### 5.1.1 Reflective Questions

1. How does mass selection differ from true breeding values in practical scenarios?
2. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of each selection method?
3. How can understanding social evolution contribute to advances in agricultural practices?
4. Can you provide an example of a successful breeding program that utilized mass selection? Explain its impact.
5. How might climate change influence the effectiveness of different breeding strategies?

### 5.1.2 Application Questions

1. Based on the case study, what would be your approach to improving crop yield using mass selection?
2. How would you modify the selection criteria if the environmental conditions change?
3. What tools and technologies could assist in better understanding and applying true breeding values?

### 5.1.3 Analytical Questions

1. Analyze the data from the practical exercise and discuss any patterns observed.
2. Compare the results of mass selection versus true breeding values based on the case study provided.
3. What genetic factors could complicate the process of selection in real-world applications?
