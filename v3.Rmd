# Practical Session on Phenotypic Value Decomposition and Selection Effects

# Introduction
Welcome to this practical session on the decomposition of phenotypic value and the effects of selection. In this session, we will explore how the phenotypic value of a plant is influenced by its genotype and by the genotypes of its neighbors, and how selection on these traits affects the next generation.

# Key Concepts

## Decomposition of the Phenotypic Value
Classically, in one single macro-environment, the phenotypic value ($P$) of an individual can be decomposed into multiple components:
$$ P = G + E $$, 
Where:
- **G** represents the genetic contribution to the phenotype.
- **E** represents the micro-environmental contribution to the phenotype.
